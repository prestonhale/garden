Why didn't you do all the simulation client-side? Its deterministic isn't it?
Yep. It is, currently, deterministic. Three reasons:
A. I wanted to learn more about web servers. Its mostly this.
B. The integrity of the simulation. I can be sure that anyone requesting the page is getting the exact same state at all times.
C. I mayyyy add interactivity down the line.
